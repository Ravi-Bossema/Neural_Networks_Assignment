# Neural Networks Assignment
An assignment on Neural Networks from one of my university courses.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install necessary libraries such as numpy and torch.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install torch
```

## Usage

Set up the hyperparameters in NN.py line 113, and run the script.

```python
# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 5e-4
batch_size = 32
epochs = 50
network_type = "CNN"  # FCN for fully connected network or CNN for convolutional neural network
```

## Authors
The files imagenette.py and assignment_4.pdf were provided by the teaching staff at the VU.

The files NN.py and Neural_Networks_Report.pdf were created and written by me.
